If you are using Teamviewer for personal use, which means any tasks within your personal life for which you are not being paid, you can download and use the free version of the software. This version allows you to connect between your own personal devices at home or help your friends and family remotely. However, there are some limitations that you should be aware of before using the free version of Teamviewer.
 
## Teamviewer Free Version Limitations
 
According to Teamviewer's website[^1^], the free version of the software has the following limitations:
 
- You cannot use it for commercial or professional purposes. This means you cannot use it to connect to your work computer, provide technical support to your customers, or conduct online training sessions for your employees. If you do so, you may violate Teamviewer's terms of service and risk being blocked or banned by the software.
- You cannot use it to connect to more than three devices at a time. This means you can only have three active sessions with different devices at any given moment. If you try to connect to more devices, you will receive a message that says "Your license limits the maximum session duration to a partner".
- You cannot use it to connect to devices that have a paid version of Teamviewer installed. This means you cannot join meetings or collaborate with other users who have a licensed version of the software. If you try to do so, you will receive a message that says "The remote TeamViewer is running an old version which is out of date".
- You may experience reduced performance and quality. This means you may encounter issues such as slow connection speed, poor video and audio quality, or frequent disconnections. This is because Teamviewer prioritizes the paid users over the free users and allocates more resources and bandwidth to them.
- You may see ads and pop-ups. This means you may see advertisements for Teamviewer's products and services on your screen or receive messages that prompt you to upgrade to a paid version of the software.

## Teamviewer Paid Version Benefits
 
If you want to use Teamviewer for commercial or professional purposes, or if you want to enjoy more features and benefits, you should consider upgrading to a paid version of the software. According to Teamviewer's website[^2^], the paid version of the software offers the following benefits:

- You can use it for any purpose without any restrictions. This means you can use it to connect to your work computer, provide technical support to your customers, conduct online training sessions for your employees, and more.
- You can use it to connect to unlimited devices at a time. This means you can have as many active sessions with different devices as you want.
- You can use it to connect to devices that have any version of Teamviewer installed. This means you can join meetings and collaborate with other users who have any version of the software, whether it is free or paid.
- You can enjoy enhanced performance and quality. This means you can experience faster connection speed, better video and audio quality, and more stable connections.
- You can access more features and functions. This means you can use advanced features such as remote printing, file transfer up to 10 GB, custom branding, device management, user management, reporting, and more.
