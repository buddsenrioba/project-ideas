In this article, I will show you how to download and use VMware vCenter Converter Boot CD 4.1.1 to perform a cold cloning of a physical machine.
 
## Step 1: Download VMware vCenter Converter Boot CD 4.1.1
 
To download VMware vCenter Converter Boot CD 4.1.1, you need to have a valid VMware account and access to VMware vCenter Server 4.1 and modules[^1^]. If you don't have it, you can create a free account and download a trial version of VMware vCenter Server 4.1 and modules from [here](https://customerconnect.vmware.com/downloads/get-download?downloadGroup=VC41).
 
Once you have access to VMware vCenter Server 4.1 and modules, you can download the VMware-VIMSetup-all-4.1.0-259021.iso file, which contains the VMware vCenter Converter Boot CD 4.1.1 image, among other components. The file size is 2.2 GB and the MD5SUM is 9eee45647a9a18d2a20a2fad641489e4.
 
## Step 2: Burn the ISO image to a CD or USB drive
 
After downloading the ISO image, you need to burn it to a CD or USB drive using your preferred software. For example, you can use [ISO to USB](https://www.isotousb.com/) or [Rufus](https://rufus.ie/) for Windows, or [balenaEtcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher/) or [UNetbootin](https://unetbootin.github.io/) for Linux or Mac OS.
 
Make sure you select the correct drive letter and format the drive as FAT32 before burning the ISO image.
 
## Step 3: Boot the source machine from the CD or USB drive
 
Once you have the CD or USB drive ready, you need to boot the source machine from it. To do this, you may need to change the boot order in the BIOS settings of the source machine, or press a key (such as F12) during startup to select the boot device.
 
When the source machine boots from the CD or USB drive, you will see a menu with two options: "VMware vCenter Converter Standalone" and "VMware ESX". Select the first option and press Enter.
 
## Step 4: Follow the wizard to convert the source machine
 
After selecting the VMware vCenter Converter Standalone option, you will see a welcome screen with some information about the tool and a license agreement. Read and accept the license agreement and click Next.
 
The next screen will ask you to specify the destination type for the conversion. You can choose between "VMware Infrastructure virtual machine" or "VMware Workstation or other VMware virtual machine". Depending on your choice, you will need to provide different information in the following screens, such as:
 
- The IP address or hostname of the VMware server where you want to store the converted virtual machine.
- The username and password for accessing the VMware server.
- The name and location of the converted virtual machine.
- The disk format (thin or thick) and size of the virtual disks.
- The network settings (DHCP or static) of the virtual machine.
- The operating system type and version of the source machine.
- The customization options (such as changing hostname, SID, etc.) for the virtual machine.

Follow the wizard and provide all the required information until you reach the summary screen. Review all the settings and click Finish to start the conversion process.
 
## Step 5: Monitor the conversion progress and verify 0f148eb4a0
